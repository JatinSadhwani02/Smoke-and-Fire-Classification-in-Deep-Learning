# Smoke-and-Fire-Classification-in-Deep-Learning
So i have implemented a Smoke and Fire Clssification model using the CNN architecture.
It can classify that the given image contains the smoke or fire and based on the image , it gives a result. 
I have defined my own CNN architecture and train my model only for two epochs and 
in only two epochs, it gave me 96% accuracy on the training data and 99% accuracy on the validation data which is really amazing.
